## Virgapes and the `virgapes` library

The Virgapes notation defines a system for encoding neumes. It was designed by members of the Chant team of the Holy Cross MID Club.  You can find initial information about the notation from their project wiki at  <https://github.com/HCMID/chant/wiki/The-Virgapes-System>.


This site is about a cross-platform code library named `virgapes`.  It is written in the Scala language, and can be compiled either for Java Virtual Machine, or Javascript. The `virgapes` library supports working with data encoded in the Virgapes notation.
