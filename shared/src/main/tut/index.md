## About

`virgapes` is a cross-platform library for working with chant encoded in the Virgapes alphabet.

The Virgapes alphabet defines a system for encoding neumes. It was designed by members of the Chant team of the Holy Cross MID Club.

See some initial docs on the notation in this page from their project wiki:  <https://github.com/HCMID/chant/wiki/The-Virgapes-System>
